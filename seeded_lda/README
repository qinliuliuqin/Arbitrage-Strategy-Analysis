NOTE:
==============
	This is the source code for the paper Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi, Hal 
	Daum√© III,Raghavendra Udupa, Incorporating Lexical Priors into Topic 
	Models, in Proceedings of EACL 2012. 

	This is a research code and is developed incrementally. So, it is not
	well organized and also some parts are not relevant. For example: the
	perplexity computation function is incorrect, if you need this then you
	need to modify the code or contact the authors. Unfortunately, this code
	is not commented at all. Use it at your own risk.

	This code assumes that the number of seed topics is same as the number 
	of regular topics. It needs to be extended when they are not the same.


Compilation:
==============
	cd src
	c++ -I../libc SeededLDA.cpp
	c++ -I../libc SeededLDA_M1.cpp
	c++ -I../libc GibbsLDA.cpp

How To Run:
==============
	
	1. Create a configuration file

		Example configuration file is provided in data/config.reuters

		Configuration file provides information about the input data (as
		indices), hyperparameter values and the seed words. Following are 
		the config options:

		 Input Data:

		  The input data is provided as a set of word and document 
		  indices. sSrcWordIndices and sSrcDocIndices are the file paths
		  of the word and document indices files respectively. Each line 
		  of these files gives information about a token in the input data, 
		  and there are as many lines as the total number of tokens. The 
		  sSrcWords file lists all the words in the vocabulary. The i^th 
		  word in the vocabulary is in i th line, so this file has as many 
		  lines as the size of the vocab.

		  sSrcWordIndices	# File path of the word indices 
		  sSrcDocIndices	# File path of the document indices 
		  sSrcWords			# File path of the actual words 

		 Parameters / Hyper-parameters:

		  iNoTopics			# Number of topics. The current code assumes
		  					that the number of topics is same as the seed
							topics.
		  iNoIterations		# Number of iterations of the sampling process.
		  dAlpha			# alpha hyperparameter value (double precision)
		  dBeta				# beta hyperparameter value (double precision)
		  dMu0				# This is beta_s hyperparameter in the paper
		  dTau0				# We set pi and tau parameters of the model to 
		  					  this parameter.

		 Seed Topics:

		  bAllowSeedTopics	# Boolean value of 1 or 0 . If this variable is set
		  					to 0 then, ideally, the result should be same as
							the GibbsLDA. But it may differ because of randomness.
		  sSeedTopicalWordsPath	
		  					# File path of the seed words. Currently, the code 
							assumes that the number seed topics is same as
							the number of regular topics. Each line of this
							file lists seed words (comma separated) for that
							topic. The number of lines should be same as the
							number of topics.

	2. Executing the programs

		There are two modes. In the first mode you can run the code and ask it
		to save the model for later use (this is referred as 'save' mode). In the
		second mode, it can load the saved model and run (referred as 'load');

		Ex: ./a.out <config_file_path> <model_path> 'save/load'

		If you specify the save mode, then the code runs and dumps the model in
		the path given. This can be used for later use.

		If you specify the load mode, then the code loads the saved model and runs.

		Alternatively, you can completely ignore the model argument as follows:

		Ex: ./a.out <config_file_path>
